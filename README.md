# Octavo

Octavo is a rich web editor, letting you edit pages on the web without viewing source. It's somewhere between the native contenteditable controls and the DOM inspector. It should work in recent WebKit and Gecko browsers, and maybe even a recent IE (untested).

Octavo is in quite early development. There are some bugs!

Usage:

    <script src="build/octavo.combo.min.js"></script>
    <h1>Some HTML here</h1>

You can also just use `build/octavo.min.js` if you don't want version bundled with jQuery and Rangy.
